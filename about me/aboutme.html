    <h2>Yuki Ikeda</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, My name is Yuki Ikeda, and I'm an international student from Japan! I'm studying marketing right now and taking programming as a minor.
        I like to play sports with my friends and doing card games. I'm so excited to learn new programming language in this class!
        I am actually not a member of the LDS church yet, but eagar to become a convert if I get a permission from my parents. Good to meet you guys!
